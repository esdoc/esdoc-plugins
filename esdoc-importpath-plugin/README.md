# ESDoc Import Path Plugin
This is a plugin that converts the import path in documentation.
ESDoc displays the import path of class/function into the document.
However, the import path may be different from real import path because usually ES2015 is transpiled to use it.

For example, ``src/MyClass.js`` will be referred to as ``import MyClass from 'my-module/src/MyClass.js'`` in the documentation.
However, in practice it is different from the real import path when you use because it is transpiled
(for example, ``import MyClass from 'my-module/lib/MyClass.js'``).

Therefore, convert the import path by using following setting.

```json
{
  "source": "./src",
  "destination": "./doc",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "esdoc-importpath-plugin",
      "option": {
        "stripPackageName": false,
        "replaces": [
          {"from": "^src/", "fromFlags": "i", "to": "lib/"}
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

``from`` is regular expression, ``fromFlags`` is flags of regular expression, and ``to``is letter. In the internal ``from``, ``fromFlags`` and ``to`` are used with ``String#replace(new RegExp (from, fromFlags), to)``.

When writing multi rules, it will also be carried out transformation many times.
For example, ``[{from: "^src/", to: "lib/"}, {from: "MyFooClass", to: "my-foo"}]`` converted as follows:

- `` my-module/src/MyFooClass.js`` => `` my-module/lib/MyFooClass.js`` => ``my-module/lib/my-foo``

``stripPackageName`` is a boolean that when set to ``true`` will strip the package name from the import path.

This is useful for projects that have custom module resolvers where you want to be able to replace the whole path.

## Install
```sh
npm install esdoc-importpath-plugin
```

## Config
